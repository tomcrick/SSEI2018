abstract = {—Along with the activity of human on social media platform increasing, social media analysis has been widely used in various fields' research, including sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework to evaluate customer satisfaction on the basis of the data from social media platform and the technology of sentiment analysis. Evaluating customer satisfaction based on the comments from social media platform is very authentic and reliable for the reason that people prefer to tell the true feeling in social media rather than in business survey. Thus our analysis result can help potential customer pick out the most suitable one according to their demands when facing so many choices. And furthermore, the result can provide great valuable insight for companies to improve their services. For better demonstrate our approach, we take six American airlines as example to explain the process minutely and our source data is collected from Twitter.},

abstract = {—Nowadays Social media has become a popular com-munication tool among Internet users. Many users share opinions and experiences on different service providers everyday through the social media platforms. Thus, these platforms become valuable sources of data which can be exploited and used efficiently to support decision-making. However, finding and monitoring customers' opinions on the social media is difficult task due to the fast growth of the content. This work focus on using Twitter for the task of building service providers' reputation. Particularly, service provider's reputation is calculated from the collected Saudi tweets in Twitter. To do so, a Saudi dialect lexicon has been developed as a basic component for sentiment polarity to classify words extracted from Twitter into either a positive or negative word. Then, beta probability density functions have been used to combine feedback from the lexicon to derive reputation scores. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach were consistent with the results of Qaym, a website that calculates restaurants' rankings based on consumer ratings and comments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Twitter provides a platform for information sharing and diffusion, and has quickly emerged as a mechanism for organizations to engage with their consumers. A driving factor for engagement is providing relevant and timely content to users. We posit that the engagement via tweets offers a good potential to discover user interests and leverage that information to target specific content of interest. To that end, we have developed a framework that analyzes tweets to identify the interests of current followers and leverages topic models to deliver a personalized topic profile for each user. We validated our framework by partnering up with a local media company and analyzing the content gap between them and their followers. We also developed a mobile application that incorporates the proposed framework.},

@article{Ibrahim2017,
abstract = {Social media such as forums, blogs and microblogs has been increasingly used for public information sharing and opinions exchange nowadays. It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers' engagement with the online brand communities on users' perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers' engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications.},

In particular, most of businesses are trying to exploit such social networking services for more profit, since it has dramatically become an information carrier for customers who are disseminating latest information about products and services. Thus, this study examines how information shared by companies is distributed and what the important factors in understanding information dissemination are. More importantly, this study classifies the types of tweets posted by a company and then to investigate the effect of these types of tweets on diffusion. By using content analysis, this study defined three types, which are i) information provision (IF), ii) advertisement (AD), and iii) both (IFAD), with 8 specific concepts. These results indicate that the differences are significant for all three types of information content. It shows that companies can spread information more quickly by providing the IFAD type rather than the AD type.},

abstract = {The ability to measure and monitor specific dimensions of brand image has a range of useful applications in marketing, from developing competitive strategy to identifying strength and weaknesses to evaluating the effectiveness of marketing initiatives. Nevertheless, obtaining reliable measurements is an ongoing challenge for marketers. Traditional methods such as administering surveys can be expensive and biased, and are limited in scale, both in terms of the number of brands and dimensions that can be tracked, and the frequency with which the measurements can be updated. The explosion of social media in recent years has created an enormous secondary data trail that is available for analysis. However, the most common analytics approaches, such as those that rely on user-generated text, are difficult to apply due to the scarcity of relevant conversations, as well as the ambiguity, variety, and often rapid changes in linguistic terms used by consumers. This paper describes a recent advance in marketing science that makes use of brand social network connections to make highly scalable inferences about brand image. This promising new approach provides many potential advantages, including the ability to fully automate monitoring for a large number of brands over a wide range of dimensions.},
