\begin{abstract}
With the increasing number of users on a variety of social media
platforms, customer service-focused organisations are recognising the
importance of social network engagement with their customers. In turn,
consumers judge organisations on the quality of customer service and
degree of responsiveness to queries. This paper presents an extensible
framework for evaluating direct engagements of customer services with
customers. It also measures indirect engagement with business rivals,
competition and their patterns and severity. By using graphs analysis
of Twitter interactions, our approach was used to provide analytical
measures and visual representations for seven UK telecoms
companies. With a dataset consisting of 15,000 tweets and 3,500 user
profiles, the results show that business providers have indirect
engagements with their rivals, and customers are the triggering factor
of those competition.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The microblogging site Twitter has become one of the main social
network platforms, providing a rich corpus of big social data to study
a range of interesting socio-cultural themes, from life event
detection~\cite{blamey-et-al-2013} and identifying language
communities~\cite{albishry-et-al:iccci2017}, through to providing
deeper insight into personality and
behaviour~\cite{mostafa-et-al-ai2016}. Twitter is increasingly being
used by organisation to communicate with customers, as it is fast and
convenient medium of engagement. In 2016, a survey was carried out on
5,450 people who follow small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) on
Twitter~\cite{Twitter2016}. Key results show that 83\% of people that
received a reply felt better about the SME, and 68.7\% have made at
least one purchase from an SME because of Twitter.

However, this medium could serve as an indicator to underlying issues
of performance, management and even strategic matters. Many studies
have been conducted to explore aspects of customer services
experiences in various business domains, such as travel and
telecoms~\cite{Shakeel2017,Zhang2016,Wattimena2017,Guercini2014,Khatoon2017}.
News agencies are not far from social media analysis, they use it to
uncover users interests so they can provide more focused
contents~\cite{Nigam2016}.  Previous works utilised were conducted to
analyse network structure and how users relate to
brands~\cite{Cutler2017}, how information shared by companies
disseminate and their types~\cite{Piccialli2017}, and what type of
engagements from companies was found to be of effect on customers
perception of the brand~\cite{Ibrahim2017}. A very common approach in
conducting such studies was using sentiment analysis, mainly to
measure consumer's perception and
satisfaction~\cite{Zhang2016,Al-Hussaini2017}.

However, the framework here is aimed to provide quantitative insights
that can produce wholistic views of customer services accounts. Rather
than focusing on individual posts and their sentiment, the framework
helps in identifying important post conversations that can then be
observed closely by analysts or decision makers. With the high volume
of activity on Twitter, the framework helps bring important issues
under the spot for further analysis. Using streaming and restful data,
the approach can be applied on live data to catch problematic
conversations once they reach certain length for example.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in
Section~\ref{method}, we introduce the methodology;
Section~\ref{results} presents the results and key visual
representations; Section~\ref{discussion} provides the main
discussion; Section~\ref{conclusions} concludes the paper with a
summary of potential extensions and applications of our work.


\section{Methodology}\label{method}

The approach in this study consists of two main steps; data
collection phases and graphs construction. The data collection
runs iteratively to obtain reply-chains, process them and save them to
database. Once the data collection phase is accomplished, a giant
graph that includes all reply nodes and edges is constructed to conduct analyses.

%\begin{figure}[htb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/frameworkstructure.png}
%\caption{Overall framework structure}
%\label{fig:frameworkstructure}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Streaming}

To ensure we have as much data as possible, data collection takes
three steps. First, a stream endpoint is opened to catch activities of
accounts under investigation, those accounts will be referred to as
`watched' or `CS' (Customer Service) accounts. Twitter streaming API
is designed to return tweets created by the user, their retweets,
replies to tweets created by the user, and retweets of their
tweets. However, the stream does not include tweets mentioning the
user, and replies/retweets by protected users. The first phase of data
collection phase started with collecting those activities, and has
accumulated about 15,000 tweets.

\subsection{Reply Chains}

Returned statuses from the Streaming API may represent reply to
statuses that have not been collected previously. We found that most
missing statuses were either posted before data collection started,
initial chain root that was not captured by the Stream API
(e.g. mentions), or the user account is protected. This issue could
hugely affect the data and their
analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:datacollectionphases} illustrates common
scenario that involves a group of reply chains after the phases of
data collection; sub-figure (a) shows five reply-chains that were
returned by the stream in their original structure. However, the
second phase returned one reply that connected the chains to become
one component, as shown in sub-figure (b).

Therefore, once statuses are returned from the stream endpoint, they
are processed to identify missing replied-to posts, and REST API is
used to collect them. This process is recursively done for newly
collected replies until no further replies are available. Unavailable
statuses are often result from either deletion or protected accounts.

Analysis of changes on the graph after the second phase of data
collection shows that there were increases in the number of nodes and
edges by 43\% and 62\%, respectively. This increase in connections has
resulted in merging 176 components into others, which improved
connectivity of the graph and, hence, accuracy of dependent analyses.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/datacollectionphases.png}
\caption{(a) First phase of data collection and (b) second phase of data
collection}
\label{fig:datacollectionphases}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Graph Construction}

\subsubsection{Main Graph}

Constructing graphs from the collected statuses is in core of all
analyses presented in this chapter. First, a base graph\footnote{The
terms `main graph' and `base graph' are used interchangeably.} is
generated containing all replies and the needed data. Nodes represent
post ids, while edges indicate replying direction. Other information
of statuses are added as attributes to nodes. The information used in
this study are screen name of the user, timestamp of the reply, text,
and `watched' entity, to identify CS accounts. An example graph is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:replychaingraph}. Properties of this graph
are constrained by how replies relate to each other. In other words,
no edge is expected to have weight value other than 1. Also, no reply
status can have outdegree greater than 1, however some nodes may have
an outdegree of 0. Node with outdegree=0 can be root nodes, i.e. first
post of conversation, or they were directed to unavailable
statuses. On the other hand, indegree of nodes can be 0 or
more. Special case nodes are those with indegree and outdegree equal
to 0. Those are isolated/floating nodes and must be removed before
analysis starts. First, those nodes do not benefit the analysis as
they are not part of any conversation. Second, they will be seen as
connected component by themselves, which affects accuracy of results.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/replychaingraph.png}
\caption{Illustrative example of a reply chain graph and base graph}
\label{fig:replychaingraph}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Users' Graph}

Because most analyses focus on relationships between reply posts, they
were applied on the base graph. Nevertheless, to examine relationships
amongst users, another graph is generated from the base graph. This
process is conducted by iterating through edges linking reply posts,
extracting users' information, and constructing users graph
accordingly. Users information are embedded in node attributes. In the
perspective of this study, only two attributes are used, names and the
`watched' values. Nodes are constructed from user names, and the
attribute of `watched' is also added. For edges, their weights
indicate number of replies sent from origin node (sender) to target
node (receiver), therefore, the user graph is directed. Applying this
process on the example in Figure~\ref{fig:replychaingraph} results in
the users graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:usersgraph}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/usersgraph.png}
\caption{Example of users' graph extracted from the previous base graph}
\label{fig:usersgraph}
\end{figure}

To examine relationships between users, five network graph properties
are measured. There were no special case nodes or edges in this graph,
as observed in the base graph. Graph properties that are used in
analysing this graph and their contextual interpretations are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl:uucentralitymeasuresinter}.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Measure} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\ 
\midrule
{\emph{Indegree}} & Number of users that sent reply to the node \\
{\emph{Weighted Indegree}} & Total number of received replies \\
{\emph{Outdegree}} & Number of users that have received a reply from
                     the node \\ 
{\emph{Weighted Outdegree}} & Total number of sent replies \\
{\emph{Edge Weight}}& Number of replies between the connecting nodes\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{User-user centrality measures interpretation}
\label{tbl:uucentralitymeasuresinter}
\end{table}

\subsection{Connected Components}

The base graph consists of many number of subgraphs, each of which
represent related replies, i.e. one conversation entity. Investigating
connected components plays a major role in identifying conversations
for accounts. They are used to measure size of conversation, their
sizes/depths, and to identify shared conversations between watched
accounts. To extract conversations that user or users were engaged in,
the process iterates through nodes in each component and examine the
`name' attributes. As soon as the search is matched, no further nodes
are examined. Then, the component is either analysed on the fly, or
returned if more intensive analysis is required.

In the base graph, number of connected components reflect
conversations, while in users graph, connected components show users
communities. Therefore, in the base graph many components should be
expected, depending on activity of the watched accounts. However, in
the users graph, number of components should not exceed the number of
watched accounts, although there might be exactly one component due to
common customers.


\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Main Accounts Activity}

As the focus of this section is on customer services, it is necessary
to investigate classes of posts to examine if they reflect purposes of
these accounts. First, total collected posts are shown
Figure~\ref{fig:totalactivity}. What is found is that all selected
accounts appear to be mostly for customer care services. It can be
seen in the distribution of posts classes in
Figure~\ref{fig:accountsactivity}, replies were at least 83.5\% of
account statuses. This confirms that all chosen accounts are mainly
used to interact with customers and handling requests and
questions. Therefore, forthcoming analyses will be based on replies
only.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/totalactivity.png}
\caption{Total activity}
\label{fig:totalactivity}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/accountsactivity.png}
\caption{Accounts activity}
\label{fig:accountsactivity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interaction and Users}

Although working hours of CS accounts is important to evaluate
activity, it is important to measure posts that are directed to those
accounts from other users and examine them in line with CS
accounts. Audience and their relations with the accounts can be
analysed directly from the main graph (i.e. post-post). However, as
user details are embedded inside post nodes, observing such
relationships will not simple task to accomplish. Therefore, user-user
graph was built from the main graph. The resulted graph contains 3,521
user nodes and 5,938 edges, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:userusergraph}. Although post-post relationship cannot
have weight higher than one, user-user edge weight indicates number of
posts in one direction, which explains the reduction in number of
nodes and edges.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/userusergraph.png}
\caption{User-user graph}
\label{fig:userusergraph}
\end{figure}

Based on Table~\ref{tbl:uucentralitymeasuresinter}, summary of the
graph is presented below in Table~\ref{tbl:uucentralitymeasures}. The
table says that {\emph{virginmedia}} received that highest number of
replies from 866 users with an average of 3.05 per user. Also, the
same account scored highest in number of recipients. The difference
between indegrees and outdegrees shows that apart from {\emph{o2}},
all accounts have outdegrees bigger that their
indegrees. Additionally, total number of sent replies is found to be
more than the number of received replies. This may reflect that those
replies were directed to non-reply posts.

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\end{table}

\subsection{Delay}

Observation of active hours provides holistic view of
activity. Additionally, calculating delays is important to provide
more detailed view at single correspondences and how long did it take
for CS to reply to posts and their averages, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:delaymeans} and summarised in
Table~\ref{tbl:delaystats}. As replies includes timestamp attribute,
the process searches for CS nodes in the main graph, and measure
temporal differences between both ending nodes on their out edges.

\end{figure}

\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{lrrrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Account} & \textbf{mean} & \textbf{stdev} & \textbf{max(hrs)} & \textbf{min(sec)} \\ 
\midrule
{\emph{btcare}} & 2.04 & 16.11 & 572.46 & 38\\
{\emph{ee}} & 1.46 & 3.39 & 19.28 & 27\\
{\emph{giffgagg}} & 1.22 & 10.25 & 159.97 & 73\\ 
{\emph{o2}} & 1.14 & 2.66 & 22.48 & 58\\
{\emph{skyhelpteam}} & 45.04 & 49.16 & 117.21 & 44\\
{\emph{virginmedia}} & 3.34 & 9.25 & 263.98 & 22\\
{\emph{vodaphoneukhelp}} & 1.92 & 5.01 & 76.51 & 50\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Summary delays statistics}
\label{tbl:delaystats}
\end{table}

\subsection{Connected Components}

Each group of replies represented by a connected component in the
post-post graph. In total, there were 3,289 conversation
components. Observing their sizes shows that the smallest component
consists of one post, while the biggest component includes 81 posts,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ccsizes}. There were 102 singular
components, and they all were found belonging to CS accounts, and were
either original tweets that have no replies or replies with no
replied-to message available. As covered earlier, missing replies are
due to deletion or protected accounts. Because they do not have any
length, single-node components will be excluded from forthcoming
analyses.

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ccsizes}, most common size of
connected components was found to be two nodes with 1,188
components. Furthermore, edges in this group of components revealed
that most of these communications were from CS accounts and directed
to customer's post. However, 25 posts came from customers and had not
been answered. This may imply that the customer's query has either
been answered or directed for further private communication.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/ccsizes.png}
\caption{Connected component sizes}
\label{fig:ccsizes}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that the size of connected components does not
necessarily reflect length of conversations, although there is a
strong correlation between size of component and length of its longest
path (0.88). These two measures for all connected components are
pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:ccsizepaths}. As can be seen, longest path
in the biggest component (81 nodes/posts) was only 1.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/ccsizepaths.png}
\caption{Size of connected components and their longest paths}
\label{fig:ccsizepaths}
\end{figure}

To further explore properties of connected components, biggest 20
components are visualised in Figure~\ref{fig:20ccpostpostgraph}. The
findings show that components with very high differences in indegree
amongst their nodes are mostly originate from CS. This is illustrated
by the components that are identified by the three big nodes in the
figure. When observed, they were all tweets of advert. Another
observation on the biggest component is that it has 81 nodes. Origin
node was a post by {\emph{o2}} and has an indegree of 80, while the
rest have indegree of zero, i.e. they were not answered. On the other
hand, the longest path component was the ranked the third biggest
component. It was found with a single leaf, and all other nodes along
the path were found with indegree=1 and outdegree=1, forming a simple
chain, uniquely coloured in
Figure~\ref{fig:20ccpostpostgraph}. Additionally, 15 of those
components were found to have originated from customer accounts, and
they all take a semi-simple chain.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/20ccpostpostgraph.png}
\caption{Largest 20 connected components in post-post graph}
\label{fig:20ccpostpostgraph}
\end{figure}

Generally, simple chains can be identified where number of edges
equals length of the longest path in component. There were 2,537
connected components exist in the form of simple chain, about 80\% of
components. Additionally, from Figure~\ref{fig:simplechainlengths}, it
can be seen that simple chains with the length 1 are the most common,
and constitute about 47\% of chains. This is in alignment with the
results of connected component sizes presented earlier. Also,
Table~\ref{tbl:delaystatscl} presents summary statistics on chains of
individual CS accounts.

\end{table}

\subsection{Coexistence and Competition}

Common connected components can be utilised to investigate competition
amongst CS accounts. The process is achieved by first identifying
components that include more than one CS account. The results show
that there were 39 common components, 38 have two CS accounts, and one
includes three accounts. The graph presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:commoncc} shows those components, with each CS account
given a colour code for identification as the legend clarifies.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/commoncc.png}
\caption{Common connected components}
\label{fig:commoncc}
\end{figure*}

To explore these relationships further, those components were merged
into another undirected CS-CS graph. Nodes represent CS accounts,
edges indicate that they have appeared in same component, and edge's
weight indicate number of times they appeared together, as presented
in Figure~\ref{fig:coexistencegraph}. Node size indicates degree of
node to show how many other CS account the node has coexisted with,
while darkness of node reflects weighted degree. It is noted that
{\emph{giffgaff}} account was not found in any common conversation.

As can be seen in the graph, {\emph{o2}} was found the only account
that have shared conversation with all other CS accounts, while
{\emph{vodafoneukhelp}} was found with least common
conversations. Nevertheless, weighted degree measure shows that
{\emph{virginmedia}} was the highest in number of common
conversations, 21 components, although its degree was only 3. This can
be explained by weight of edges in the graph. The heaviest edge
existed between {\emph{virginmedia}} and {\emph{btcare}}, followed by
the edge between {\emph{virginmedia}} and {\emph{skyhelpteam}}. Also,
edges of {\emph{o2}} show that it was mostly appeared with
{\emph{ee}}, and for {\emph{vodafoneukhelp}} it was {\emph{ee}}.

The observation of edges and their weights can provide insights to
uncover more specific service areas within the business domain. This
was found clear when modularity of the graph was examined. The result
has unfolded into two communities, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:modularityclassgraph}. Also, general knowledge about
those CS teams; {\emph{ee}}, {\emph{o2}}, and {\emph{vodafoneukhelp}}
belong to business domain that is mostly focused on mobile services,
while {\emph{skyhelpteam}}, {\emph{virginmedia}}, and {\emph{btcare}}
are mostly known to be focusing on home internet and landline
services.

\label{fig:modularityclassgraph}
\end{figure}

The results encouraged us to further evaluate if presence of
competitor would influence the speed of which CS team reply. Although
the expectation was to see improvement, this was not the case with one
group of CS teams, as Figure~\ref{fig:diffdelaymeans} shows. Rather
strangely, drop in performance was found amongst those CS belong to
the same community.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The analysis of selected CS accounts started with measuring statuses
type to testify whether the CS account are dedicated for customer
services or not. This step is important to confirm that accounts are
similar in their purposes, hence comparison would be fair and valid.

Volume of account activity and served customers and their interactions
with the account give measures on popularity of the account on Twitter
and may help make inferences on the size of their customers who are on
Twitter. From these three measures, {\emph{virginmedia}} was found with
highest volume of posts, the least diverse in terms of type of posts
(99.7\% were replies) and has the highest number of customers.

The results also show that high availability, i.e. longer activity
hours, was not found to significantly improve speed of reply to
customers. Also, average delays of accounts ranged between 1.14 and
3.34 hours, apart from {\emph{skyhelpteam}} which was found with an average
delay of 45.04 hours. This may indicate a management issue for the
team, such as unclear social media strategy and team size. 

In the analysis of common/shared connected components, competition was
found to have taken place amongst accounts. Particularly, in the case
of {\emph{virginmedia}} and {\emph{btcare}} the competition was
obvious and severe. Although no record shows that CS team has been in
a direct engagement with a competitor, the conversations were directed
to customers. In all cases, customers were found to be initiators of
competing conversations by making use of Twitter mention feature to
bring different rivals into conversations. In contrast to phone or
email, complaints that are taken to social media are perceived as more
damaging to the business reputation. Therefore, improvement in the
speed of response was witnessed in few cases where business rivals
appeared in the same conversation. This indicates that the platform
helps customers tend to take the advantage of Twitter to win good
deals or speed resolving their problems. Additionally, although all
accounts were from telecommunication domain, competition analysis
uncovered more specialised communities.


\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

The paper has presented a framework for evaluating customer services
performance and their communities on Twitter. Network graphs
properties lay in core of all analyses to obtain the presented
results, and were applied on some selected accounts in the telecoms
business domain in the UK.

As shown in the Section~\ref{method}, there are two preliminary
techniques that need to be applied prior to starting the analysis
phase. First, the recursive reply-chain data collection is a crucial
stage in obtaining more accurate results. The importance of this stage
stems from the fact that it fills the gaps and improve connectivity of
graphs. Second, construction of the initial graph from replies and the
removal of floating isolated nodes. Then, it is a matter of correctly
choose needed information and attach them as attributes to nodes. In
this study, information included were id of post, timestamps, screen
name, text and watched flag. Nevertheless, the framework can be
extended to include other information such retweets.

Furthermore, once the main graph is constructed, other graphs could be
generated based on purposes of analysis. The connected components
section showed how conversations of certain features can be extracted
for further analysis. Examples presented in the section include
lengths of conversations and coexistence of business rivals.

The presented framework can be used by service providers to evaluate
their social media accounts, as well as make observations about their
rivals within the domain. Moreover, with the emerging practice of
signing reply with member initials, this practice can be exploited to
extend this framework. This extension could help in estimating team
sizes, working shifts and to evaluate individual team members. Another
application would be to identify gaps, competitions, challenges and
opportunities in services that can be used in drawing strategies for
start-ups for example. The approach can also be applied to other
domains or contexts, such non-profit or government institutes. Also,
it can be used for group of users, such as celebrities and their
direct and indirect confrontations on Twitter.
